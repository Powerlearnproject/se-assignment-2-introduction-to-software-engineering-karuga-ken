# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
-->This is a branch of computer science that deals with the designing and developing then testing the developed product, software engineering also entails maintaining
the product. Engineering principles are applied by software engineers in-order to build complete products for the end users

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
--> Programming in usually centred around the code but in software development there are defined steps that are considered in the development of a software product
there are usually known and tested methods 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
--> PLANNING: here the purpose of the application is defined, feasibility study also takes place here
--> REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS: here the developers identify the requirements of the final user
--> DESIGN: the framework is built and the team outlines the functionality of the system, this phase acts as link between the previous phases 
-->  CODING: Here the developers convert the design into code this phase aims to develop a system that is user-centric
-->TESTING: In this phase the quality assurance team inspects the system and highlights the bugs and how they can be fixed, this phase is very essential as it ensures the system meets the requirements
--> DEPLOYMENT: The product is now ready to be presented to the client and is now pushed to production, this signifies the shift from development to production.
--> MAINTENANCE: Here the product is maintained and has constant upgrades to adapt to the industry trends

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
--> Waterfall method follows a linear approach and the requirements for the products are provided upfront and documentation is done before the project transitions to the next phase
 it is best for projects that well understood and there is minimal change once the project starts on the other hand Agile allows refinements and improvements throughout the phases of the 
 project it characterized with adapting quickly to trends 

Requirements Engineering: 
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
--> this involves identifying, analysing and documenting the needs and expectations of a product before development starts
Software Design Principles: 
--> Problem Partitioning, Abstraction, Modularity amd Top down and Bottom up strategy

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
--> Modularity specifies the division of software into separate modules where they are named differently and later integrated together in-order to come up with a full software application

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
--> Unit testing: this is where different units of the system are tested independently to make sure they are usable by the developers 
--> integration testing: in this phase the units that were tested are integrated and tested to determine whether they work, the errors and bugs are then identified here.
--> System testing: The complete integrated system is tested here.
--> acceptance testing: Here the quality of the system is checked to ensure that the user needs are met 

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
--> version controls are softwares that help software development teams manage changes in code overtime, they help reduce development time and allow for fast deployment of the systems 
examples include: -->  GIT, Unity version control 

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
--> monitor project progress and deadlines
--> plan and develop project timeline
--> managing the budget
--> Trouble shooting and maintenance
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
--> software maintenance refers to the process of correcting defects on a system that has been delivered to a user, not only does it involve correcting the changes but also adding new
features that enhance the functionality of the product --> we have corrective maintenance, adaptive maintenance, perfective maintenance, preventive maintenance.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
-->Privacy and data security
--> Conflict of interest and quality assurance 
--> being transparent
